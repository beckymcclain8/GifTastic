# GifTastic

This is an app that generates gifs!  There are premade buttons at the top of the app with various TV show names.  When you push one of the buttons the app will generate 10 gifs based on that TV show.  If you want to add another button with a different TV show, type it into the search on the right, and a new button with your title will appear!  

The gifs will load as a still picture. If you would like to animate them, just click on the picture.  You can click again to stop the animation.  Have fun!
