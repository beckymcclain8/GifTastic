# GifTastic

This is an app that generates gifs!  There are premade buttons at the top of the app.  When you push one of the buttons it will generate 10 gifs based on the name of the button.  If you want to add another button with a different name, type it into the search on the right.  It will create a button and then generate 10 gifs for you of that topic.  The gifs will load as a still picture. If you would like to animate them, just click on the picture.  You can click again to stop the gif from being animated.  Have fun!
